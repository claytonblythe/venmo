### Venmo Transaction Analysis

This is a project I just randomly decided to do last night because I read that venmo had a public API that would return all of the worlds transactions, 
assuming they remained with the default "public" visibility option.

I don't necessarily agree with venmo's decision to provide all of this data publicly, but since it is and I find the data interesting, I thought I might as well analyze it and bring it to the public's attention.

Here I use python to hit the public API and store all transactions in a relational database. I plan on accumulating a few million unique payments and then doing some analysis on the data, like looking at the most frequently used emoji's, looking at the most active users, analyzing trends in payment frequency per day of the week among many more ideas.

I think this data is really interesting, and have lots of ideas!
